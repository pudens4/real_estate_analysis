# real_estate_analysis


# Overview

In this project, I analyze real estate data to get insight and find if there is a correlation between property age, rent, the amount deposited, and features. 

# Findings 

The data contains 4930 property, and 22826 unique prospects. 
Which means on average, each property is sought after by an average of 4 prospects.
avg = 22826/4930

<br/>

* From these properties, the average deposit is 
$83,128,441

* the average monthly rent is $1,052,041 

* the average room quantity is 1.471 and the max is 5

* Out of the 4930 properties 3188 does not have an elevator and 1725 has one while there is no data for the other 17. 
* The average year is 13.65

<br/>
These prelimary stats showed that these properties are high end real estates. Most likely sought by wealthy individuals. 
As the average of the room is less than 2, I gather they are not residential properties in the suburbs. More likely in big cities.
